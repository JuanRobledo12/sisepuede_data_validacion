"Now [1], a typical range of FCEBs (fuel cell electric buses) is from 4 to 7 kg (of H2)/100 km"

=> We take the mid point = 5.5 kg (of H2)/100 km 

According to URL: https://h2tools.org/hyarc/hydrogen-data/hydrogen-density-different-temperatures-and-pressures

Hydrogen density at 25 celsius and 50Mpa = 30.811 kg/m3 =0.030811 kg/L

According to URL https://civitas.eu/sites/default/files/civ_pol-an_web.pdf

"Hydrogen tank pressure typically 350 or 700 bar" 

We take the mid point: 500 bar = 50 Mpa 

Finally

5.5 kg/100 km = 0.055 kg/km

=> 18.1818181818 km/kg = 0.5602 km/L
