ZeroAvia's HyFlyer II: This prototype aircraft is a modified six-seat Piper Malibu that is powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. It has a range of up to 500 km and a cruising speed of around 220 km/h. ZeroAvia estimates that the HyFlyer II has an energy efficiency of around 4 km/L, which is equivalent to a fuel consumption of 0.25 kg/km per passenger. (Source: https://www.zeroavia.com/)

Airbus ZEROe concept aircraft: Airbus has unveiled three ZEROe concept aircraft designs that are powered by hydrogen fuel cells. The three designs have different configurations and seating capacities, but they all have ranges of up to 2,000 nautical miles (3,704 km). Airbus estimates that the hydrogen-powered aircraft could achieve fuel efficiency of around 2.2-2.5 km/L, which is comparable to that of conventional aircraft.

Overall, hydrogen-powered aircraft have the potential to be much more efficient than conventional aircraft in terms of specific energy, but their actual efficiency will depend on a range of technical and practical factors.

We will take the average value (4+2.2+2.5)/3 km/L = 2.9 km/L
