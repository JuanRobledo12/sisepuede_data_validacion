According to: https://www.eia.gov/biofuels/biomass/#:~:text=Domestic%20sales%20of%20densified%20biomass,and%20averaged%20%24196.98%20per%20ton

"Domestic sales of densified biomass fuel in October 2022 were 0.22 million tons and averaged $212.23 per ton. Exports in October 2022 were 0.71 million tons and averaged $196.98 per ton."

We will use the average of the imports and exports cost:

(212.23+196.98)/2=204.605 USD/ton = 0.204605 USD/kg

"The bulk density of fresh biomass is in the ranges of 80-100 kg m 3 in agricultural residues and 150-200 kg m 3 in woody biomass [9]. After being crushed, bulk density of the biomass raw materials increased with the suggested minimum bulk density of 200 kg/m 3 [10]."

Biomass assumed density = 200 kg/m 3

0.204605 USD/kg = 40.921 USD/kg
