aditional_information:
      assumptions: >
            - Fuel consumption rates are around 8 kg-H2/100 km. This value is set to all countries for all 2000-2020.    
            - The fuel economy improvement rate is set at 1 % from 2020 to 2050 for fuel cell.
            - 1 Kilogram of Hydrogen is equal to 14.128 Liters
            - Convert LGE/100km  unit to sisepuede unit km/l [ km/l = ((LGE/100km)^-1)*(100)  ].
