"Mainline Locomotives are used for passenger and freight transport and operate mostly on major
routes."

Figure 6: Overview of the Mainline Locomotives case studies including economic and
environmental results

H2 average consumption = (0.67 + 0.82 + 0.48)/3 kg/km = 0.656666 kg/km => 1.52284 km/kg 


Hydrogen density at 25 celsius and 50Mpa = 30.811 kg/m3 = 0.030811 kg/L

Then 

H2 average consumption = 0.04692030456 km/L
