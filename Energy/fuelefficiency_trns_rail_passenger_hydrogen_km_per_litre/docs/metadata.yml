"Multiple Units are widely used for passenger transport in Europe today" 

Figure 4: Overview of the Multiple Units case studies including economic and environmental
results

H2 average consumption = (0.36 + 0.31 + 0.22)/3 kg/km = 0.2966 kg/km => 3.37154416723 km/kg 

Hydrogen density at 25 celsius and 50Mpa = 30.811 kg/m3 = 0.030811 kg/L

Then 

H2 av. Cons. = 0.10388064733 km/L
