Units: Tera Jloue/10^9 USD


 Energy in Peta Joules obtained from: International Energy Agency, available on the IEA data and statistics webpage (https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-sets)

GDP data: Socioeconomid Variables


Assumptions: 

    # #scoe crowss walk 
    # scoe_energy_demands = {
    #    consumpinit_scoe_gj_per_hh_residential_elec_appliances : [all but (residential space heating +residential cooking+ clothes dryers)]
    #    consumpinit_scoe_gj_per_hh_residential_heat_energy : [residential space heating +residential cooking+ clothes dryers]
    #    consumpinit_scoe_tj_per_mmmgdp_commercial_municipal_elec_appliances : (share of electric in residential [0-1.0])*0.9*[sheet: services, End use =="other building energy use" & PRoduct= "total final energy"]
    #    consumpinit_scoe_tj_per_mmmgdp_commercial_municipal_heat_energy  (1- share of electri in residential)*0.9*[sheet: services, End use =="other building energy use" & PRoduct= "total final energy"]
    #    consumpinit_scoe_tj_per_mmmgdp_other_se_elec_appliances :  (share of electric in residential [0-1.0])*0.1*[sheet: services, End use =="other building energy use"]
    #    consumpinit_scoe_tj_per_mmmgdp_other_se_heat_energy (1-share of electric in residential [0-1.0])*0.1*[sheet: services, End use =="other building energy use"]

    If 'End use' energy data is missing in IEA dataset then:
        If it is present for some years:
            the missing historic values are obtained as the mean value of the present data
        Else:
            A multi-linear regression trained with the end use energy value as function of the rural population, urban population
            and GDP in the Socioeconomic folder is used to compute the missing values.

    Projected values for energy are obtained with the previously mentioned multi-linear regression
	with the pop_ur, pop_ru and gdp projected values from the Socioeconomic folder.
