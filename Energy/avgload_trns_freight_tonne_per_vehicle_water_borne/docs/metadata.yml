According to:

"Average-sized cargo ships weigh in the range of around 165,000 tons, but smaller and larger vessels (50,000 tons and 220,000 tons, respectively) are also quite common amongst vessels used for this purpose."

We will take the average of these quantities, i.e., (165000+50000+220000)/3=145000 tone per vehicle.

Assumptions:

Average vehicle capacity is the average load, meaning that in average the maximum capacity of all vehicles is reached.
