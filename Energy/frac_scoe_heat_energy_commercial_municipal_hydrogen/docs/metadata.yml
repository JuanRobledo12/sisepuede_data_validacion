Units: ratio [0-1]

Source:

    Energy in Peta Joules obtained from: International Energy Agency, available on the IEA data and statistics webpage (https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-sets)

Assumptions:

-frac_scoe variables use 'Total Services' values from the 'Services - Energy' sheet in tha IEA data set

Fuel fractions are given according to the following dictionaries:

cross_walk_dict={'frac_scoe_heat_energy_X_coal':[(1,'Coal and coal products (PJ)')],
'frac_scoe_heat_energy_X_diesel': [(0.8,'Oil and oil products (PJ)')],
'frac_scoe_heat_energy_X_electricity':[(0.1,'Electricity (PJ)')],
'frac_scoe_heat_energy_X_gasoline':[(0.1,'Oil and oil products (PJ)')],
'frac_scoe_heat_energy_X_hydrocarbon_gas_liquids':[(1,'Other sources (PJ)')],
'frac_scoe_heat_energy_X_hydrogen':[(0,'Oil and oil products (PJ)')],
'frac_scoe_heat_energy_x_kerosene':[(0.1,'Oil and oil products (PJ)')],
'frac_scoe_heat_energy_X_natural_gas': [(1,'Gas (PJ)'),(1,'Heat (PJ)')],
'frac_scoe_heat_energy_X_solid_biomass':[(1,'Biofuels and waste (PJ)')]}

Inputed values for all the countries are given by the fraction of the present value countries that correspond to the same GDP class.

GDP class is a binary classification where the countries above the mean GDP global value belong to one class and those bellow to another class.
