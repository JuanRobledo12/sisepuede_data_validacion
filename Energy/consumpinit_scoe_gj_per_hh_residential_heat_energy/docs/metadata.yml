Units: Giga Joules/Number of households

Source:

    Energy in Peta Joules obtained from: International Energy Agency, available on the IEA data and statistics webpage (https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-sets)

    Number of households taken from Socioeconomic data, given by
    hh = round((pop_ru+pop_ur)/occ_rate)

Assumptions: 

    If 'End use' energy data is missing in IEA dataset then:
        If it is present for some years:
            the missing historic values are obtained as the last historical mean
        Else:
            A mean PJ/GDP/CAP for some significant countries is computed and imputed with the corresponding GDP and Population of the missing countries.

    Projected values for energy are obtained by computing the growth ratio of GDP per caprita and applied to the last historical value.
